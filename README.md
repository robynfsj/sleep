# Sleep data visualisations in R

I created this project to practice creating visualisations in R as I need to use R for the analysis of my PhD data but 
have gotten used to using Python recently.   

The project is an analysis of my sleep data from the [Sleep Cycle app](https://www.sleepcycle.com), which I also used 
for my Code First Girls Python project. There are two scripts:   

[sleep-cycle.R](https://github.com/robynfsj/sleep/blob/master/sleep-cycle.R) – all my own code where I have tryed to 
recreate something similar to the visualisations in the Sleep Cycle app itself  

[nguyen.R](https://github.com/robynfsj/sleep/blob/master/nguyen.R) – a script modified from Nguyen (2018), which I 
decided to use as it contained some interesting visualisations and packages I have not used before such as ggridges  


## Example Visualisations
